column,description
marker,Name of SNP marker
chr,Chromosome
bp_mm10,Physical position in basepairs for mm10 mouse genome build
strand,Strand (plus/minus) from which the probe sequence was taken
snp,SNP alleles as a two-character string
unique,TRUE indicates that the probe sequence appears exactly once in mm10 mouse genome build
unmapped,TRUE indicates that the probe sequence has no perfect match in mm10 mouse genome build
probe,Probe sequence (49 or 50 bases); the SNP occurs immediately after
